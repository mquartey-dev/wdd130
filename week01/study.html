Starting a path with "/" will go to the root folder and start there.
Starting a path with "../" will go one folder up and start there.
Starting a path with "../../" will go two folders up and start there (and so onâ€¦).
Starting a path with "./" indicates to start in the current folder.
To move forward, or down a sub folder, start with the first sub-folder and include a "/" after each subfolder name.
